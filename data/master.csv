krynixk#0,2024,101,Rejected,University of Waterloo,Computer Engineering,97.0,,,,"In Waterloo's embrace, students feel the strain, A labyrinthine campus, a competitive reign. Where creativity stifles, and stress takes its toll, In the shadow of academia, dreams lose their control. Oh Waterloo, your halls echo with despair, As students navigate, lost in their own nightmare. But in defiance, a flicker of light, For those who dare, to reclaim their right. In the heart of this struggle, hope's ember burns bright, That one day, Waterloo might see the light."

Grew from about 6 to 15 members.

Led design of teaching for debate club (peaked at 6th place speaker in CSDF Ontario provincials, won/2nd place in CSDF regionals for both BP and CP each of 4 years). Grew from about 7 to 20 members.

Led trivia club (reach for the top regionals winner for 3 consecutive yrs, provincials placed 17th and 9th, junior didn't have provincials on the year of our first win; 4th place consensus trivia). Grew from just my team (4 people lol) to 16 members. I love this club to death.

SHAD Canada (best prototype) and TKS. Taught debate at a summer camp and cleaned windows for some extra money. 

Volunteered at a local election advocacy group, since our city council was pulling some shady stuff with corrupt land developers. Voter turnout spiked and our government changed. I worked mostly on developing voting profiles from combing through council meetings to figure out how councillors voted. Organized a few environmental cleanup initiatives with some friends/friends of friends, which were mostly just 8 or so kids cleaning trash out of the moraine.

Coding on the side (lots of simulations and some dabbling in AI systems, sometimes these two overlapped). All for fun/experimentation, nothing practical beyond a few odd websites for cash.

I do a worldbuilding project in my spare time; it's my creative outlet for my writing where I use software to simulate climate and try to create a ground-up, hard sci-fi world. There are sentient webs of tiny robots that try to bypass entropy. It's fun times.

Brazilian jiu-jitsu and rock climbing, neither competitively. Only academic scholarship conditional on grades (President's Scholarship of Distinction) My school was exceptionally small, around 350 people, so leadership wasn't particularly competitive per se. (I'd like to think I did an alright job regardless... :P)

I took the full IB diploma (HL AA Math, HL Chemistry, HL English Lang/Lit, SL Physics, SL Economics, SL French B).

My writing is probably quite strong compared to the field (English was my best subject & I plan to take a philosophy minor, and I'm a CS applicant). This likely helped with paragraphs."

Then for the videos, I mentioned something about planning for a bake sale by HOSA and bringing forward someone’s ideas to make them feel heard(or was it maybe the booth for the annual school bbq??). Then, I got a question like “What is critical thinking and why is it important to you?” where I just yapped (“as engineers/problem solving/considerate of others’ opinions”). Then for my third video, I mentioned that I wanted to MC for a cultural event at the local volunteer/non-profit organization (the question was something along the lines of if I felt like I had let someone down, what did I do about it and how did it turn out) that I’m a volunteer at, but I couldn’t MC because I had to get vaccinated that day. I felt like I had let them down because I informed them the night before, even if they were okay with it. Then after I saw how the event had turned out, I was happy that they’re promoting equity in Canada. Just be true to yourself and sound confident in your interviews. nan"

chrispeng515@gmail.com,2025,Group A,Offer,McMaster University,Integrated Biomedical Engineering and Health Sciences,97.5,,,,"KIRA (1 written, 3 video) 1. Written: Wrote about ECs. The question asked about my involvement in a community of some sort. 2. Video: Talked about my ability to work in a group and encourage quiet or shy members to contribute their ideas. 3. Video: A logic problem that asks the three biggest obstacles to solving a problem when insufficient information is given, something like that. 4. Video: Tell me about a time when you let yourself down. I told a story about poor time management, procrastination, and not taking something important seriously enough. I also included what I learned from that situation. Honestly, for the KIRA talent questions, what they are looking for is key qualities from what you write or say that will make you a fit for your program. Definitely use ECs or experiences as ways of proving these qualities and make sure to reflect on what you experienced to show your personal growth—I think interviewers in general place a fair emphasis on that. Good luck to everyone on their uni apps!"

I think the second part (ie. the one you have to show how you approach current scenarios) of my supp app, was kinda weak looking back. It was more objective and honestly, I didn't make really strong points. Either way, I am happy with what I wrote for my supp app in the first section. My tip to those applying next year is to get someone to read over your supp app and be brutally honest whether it's convincing/moving or not. Good luck!!"

r1thm.business.queries@gmail.com,2025,Group A,Offer,Queen's University,Smith Commerce,97.0,,,,"KIRA (1 10-Minute Writing, and 1 Video Interview) I did not mention a single EC. for the class of '26 and onwards, listen up! i hate it when people say ""be authentic!"" without much guidance on what that quite means. so maybe this wall of text helps. disclaimer: im not affiliated with Queen's admissions, therefore, i have no idea what actually led to my offer; i could just be yappin for nothing lol. you have been warned. also, stick to the supplementary rubric Queen's posted officially too. i want to start by saying that QComm doesn't want your references (unlike Ivey / Schulich), meaning that they don't really care about your ECs. as impressive as your ECs might be, Queen's admissions doesn't have the mentality to actually verify them (they might audit occasionally though, who knows). therefore, it's best to stick to whatever u feel is genuine to the heart. for me, i wrote a story with dialogue, for other students, they might use a poem, or delve into a truly unique experience. if in the end, you still think tying an EC into your application helps, then make sure you talk about it! it's all part of your identity and should really should share that aspect of urself. although i had a ton of ECs and awards i could've shared, i said none of that on my app. i started talking about my elementary school experiences instead, because i found it far more interesting. you certainly don't need to replicate this formula, but it does help during your 15 minute combined interview to discuss something you are really excited about & something the interviewer should know abt. after all, no one wants to read for the 100th time of a student's ""lifechanging"" moment at QLEAD or SHAD if you don't discuss what you gained from it; theres hundreds of other students writing the same EC as a flex in their Queen's app, and not as a transferable experience. do better. do you. im happy to talk more about queens or OUAC in general! shoot me a quick DM: r/Interesting-Coyote89"
